                        Lead Token is the native currency that fuels the products and services that are delivered on Lead Wallet ecosystem. Thereby making Lead token a utility token as it will be needed to access some major service areas of the wallet platform. <br>
                        The Lead Token is minted on the Ethereum VM as an ERC20 standard token. There will only be a total of one billion Lead Token supply to ever exist.

                        The Lead Wallet revenue is generated from nearly all products and services offered via the Lead Wallet application. It is designed with a deflationary monetary system whereby 30% of Lead Wallet quarterly profits are used to purchase LEAD from the exchanges and are permanently burnt out of circulation. <br>

                        Lead Wallet revenue will be generated from all the products and services offered via the Lead Wallet application, and we provide a quarterly audit to ensure transparency. Every Quarter, Lead team will conduct an audit of all the earnings from Lead Wallet, after which 30% of the total net profit will be used to buy back a portion of the Lead token, which will be permanently burnt. This process will continue until only 30% of the total LEAD supply is left.

                            The team only gets 15% of the total token distribution as we do not want this project to enrich the select few. We believe that the community deserves to get the most out of our project. Please take a look at the chart below to see how we are going to distribute the tokens:
